## Introduction

`Open-ChatGPT`  is a open-source library that allows you to train a  hyper-personalized ChatGPT-like ai model using your own data and the least amount of compute possible.

`Open-ChatGPT` is a general system framework for enabling an end-to-end training experience for ChatGPT-like models. It can automatically take your favorite pre-trained large language models though an OpenAI InstructGPT style three stages to produce your very own high-quality ChatGPT-style model.

We have Impleamented RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) powered by transformer library and DeepsSpeed. It supports distributed training and offloading, which can fit extremly large models.

## Illustrating  RLHF

ChatGPT continues the technical path of [InstructGPT/GPT3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) and adds RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) which enhances the adjustment of the model output by humans and sorts the results with greater understanding.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a challenging concept as it involves multiple model training processes and different deployment stages. We break down the training process into three core steps:

### Step 1: Train Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

GPT 3.5 itself has difficulty in understanding the different intentions implied in various types of human instructions, and it is also difficult to judge whether the generated content is of high quality. To make [GPT 3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) initially understand the intent of instructions, high-quality answers are given by human annotators for randomly selected questions in the dataset, and the GPT-3.5 model is fine-tuned with these manually labeled data to obtain the SFT model (Supervised Fine-Tuning).

The SFT model at this point is already better than GPT-3 in following instructions/dialogues, but may not necessarily align with human preferences.

</div>

### Step 2: Train Reward Model (RM)

The main objective of this stage is to train a reward model by manually labeled training data (about 33K data). Questions are randomly selected from the dataset, and multiple different answers are generated for each question using the model generated in the first stage. Human annotators consider these results comprehensively and provide a ranking order. This process is similar to a coach or teacher's guidance.

Next, use this ranking result data to train the reward model. For multiple ranking results, pairwise combinations form multiple training data pairs. The RM model accepts an input and provides a score that evaluates the quality of the answer. Thus, for a pair of training data, the parameters are adjusted so that the score for a high-quality answer is higher than that for a low-quality answer.

</div>

### Step 3: Optimize the Policy Using Reinforcement Learning(RLHF)

Finally, once we have the trained SFT model and reward model (RM), we can use reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune the SFT model based on feedback using RM. This step keeps our SFT model aligned with human preferences.

This stage uses the reward model trained in the second stage and updates the pre-trained model parameters based on the reward score. Questions are randomly selected from the dataset, and the PPO model is used to generate answers, and the RM model trained in the previous stage is used to provide quality scores. The reward scores are passed in sequence, resulting in a policy gradient, and the PPO model parameters are updated through reinforcement learning.

## RLHF Dataset preparation

To successfully train a ChatGPT-like assistant, you need 3 different datasets: `actor_training_data`, `rlhf_training_data` and `reward_training_data`.

Alternatively, training can be bootstrapped using a pre-existing dataset available on HuggingFace.  High quality candidates are namely the `Anthropic HH RLHF` and the `Stanford Human Preference datasets`, `Reddit TL;DR dataset` and  `Comparisons datasets`.

## ☕ Quick Start ☕

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jianzhnie/open-chatgpt.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

### Example1: Learning to summarize with human feedback

#### Step1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Firstly, we will fine-tune the transformer model for text summarization on the [`TL;DR`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CarperAI/openai_summarize_tldr) dataset.

This is relatively straightforward. Load the dataset, tokenize it, and then train the model. The entire pipeline is built using HuggingFace.

- Training with huggingface transformers trainer api.

First, modify the `training_args` in `train_fintune_summarize.py` file with your own param.

```shell
cd scripts/
python train_reward_model.py
```

- Speedup training with deepspeed

First, add the `deepspeed` param in  `train_fintune_summarize.py` file.

```python
# Prepare the trainer and start training
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=output_dir,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    eval_steps=500,
    save_steps=1000,
    warmup_steps=100,
    learning_rate=1e-5,
    weight_decay=0.001,
    half_precision_backend=True,
    fp16=True,
    adam_beta1=0.9,
    adam_beta2=0.95,
    fp16_opt_level='02',  # mixed precision mode
    do_train=True,  # Perform training
    do_eval=True,  # Perform evaluation
    save_strategy='steps',
    save_total_limit=5,
    evaluation_strategy='steps',
    eval_accumulation_steps=1,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    gradient_checkpointing=True,
    logging_steps=50,
    logging_dir='./logs',
    deepspeed='./ds_config_opt.json',
)
```

Then, run the following command to start training.

```shell
deepseed train_fintune_summarize.py
```

The model is evaluated using the ROUGE score. The best model is selected based on the average ROUGE score on the validation set. This model will be used to initialize the reward model, which will be further fine-tuned using PPO.

#### Step2: Training the Reward Model

Our reward model is trained on a collected human quality judgement dataset [Comparisons dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CarperAI/openai_summarize_comparisons), You can download the dataset from huggingface automatically.

We will initialize the reward model from the SFT model and attach a randomly initialized linear head to output a scalar value on top.

Next, we will delve into how the data is input to the model, the loss function, and other issues with the reward model.

Use these code to train your reward model.

```shell
cd scripts/
python train_reward_model.py
```

#### Step3: Fine-Tuning the Model using PPO

We use [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) as example dataset. It is a small dataset with hundreds of prompts.

```python
python train_ppo_rlhf.py
```

### Example2: Learning to generate positive sentiment with human feedback

python gpt2-sentiment.py
```

### Example3: StackLLaMA: Train LLaMA with RLHF on StackExchange

```shell
