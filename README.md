## Introduction

`Open-ChatGPT` is a open-source library that allows you to train a hyper-personalized ChatGPT-like ai model using your own data and the least amount of compute possible.

`Open-ChatGPT` is a general system framework for enabling an end-to-end training experience for ChatGPT-like models. It can automatically take your favorite pre-trained large language models though an OpenAI InstructGPT style three stages to produce your very own high-quality ChatGPT-style model.

We have Impleamented RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) powered by transformer library and DeepsSpeed. It supports distributed training and offloading, which can fit extremly large models.

If you like the project, please show your support by [leaving a star ‚≠ê](https://github.com/jianzhnie/open-chatgpt/stargazers).

## News

- \[2023/04\] We released **RLHF(Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)  Pipeline** .
