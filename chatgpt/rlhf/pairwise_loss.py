    """Pairwise Loss for Ranking Tasks.

    This PyTorch module computes a pairwise loss for ranking tasks where the
    goal is to compare two inputs and determine which one is "better" than the
    other. Given two input tensors: `chosen_reward` and `reject_reward`, which
    should contain reward values for the "chosen" and "rejected" options,
    respectively, this module computes the probability of the chosen option
    being "better" than the rejected option using a sigmoid function, and then
    takes the negative logarithm of that probability to get the loss. The loss
    is then averaged over the batch dimension and returned as a scalar tensor.
    Note that this module assumes that higher reward values indicate better
    options.
